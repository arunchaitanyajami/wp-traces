# wp-traces
A simple plugin to show you exactly what actions are being called when you run WordPress.

Instructions:
===============
1. Install the plugin. (This is a test, if you don't know how to install a plugin from github then this is the wrong plugin for you.)
1. Activate
1. Open a page in your WordPress powered site
1. Add showDebugTrace=1 to the URL (put a ? or & before it as appropriate)
1. Scroll to the bottom of the page

Options:
========
+ <CODE><STRONG>debug_race=1</STRONG></CODE> This turns the display on. If you have the plugin installed and activated but don't put this on the URL, nothing will show. The plugin is still active, and will still slow your site down, but it will not display anything.
+ <CODE><STRONG>debug_time=1</STRONG></CODE> This will force the plugin to show you the time - as generated by <code>[microtime()](http://php.net/manual/en/function.microtime.php)</code> - that the action was executed.
+ <CODE><STRONG>debug_args=1</STRONG></CODE> This will force the plugin to display the arguments that the plugin was called with, if any.
